# Operators

## difference between == and === operators

1. == (loose equality): Compares two values for equality after converting both values to a common type.
2. === (strict equality): Compares two values for equality without performing type conversion.

- instanceof operator: The instanceof operator tests whether an object has in its prototype chain the prototype property of a constructor.

- typeof operator: The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

```js
typeof(12)
//output is "number"
typeof("Hello");
//output "string"
```
