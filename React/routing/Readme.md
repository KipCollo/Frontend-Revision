# Routing

outing is an essential concept in Single Page Applications (SPA). When your application is divided into separated logical sections, and all of them are under their own URL, your users can easily share links among each other.

## React Router

React router is the most famous library when it comes to implementing routing in React applications.

## Reach Router

Reach Router is a small, simple router for React that borrows from React Router, Ember, and Preact Router. Reach Router has a small footprint, supports only simple route patterns by design, and has strong (but experimental) accessibility features.
