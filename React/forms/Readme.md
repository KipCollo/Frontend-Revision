# Forms

Although you can build forms using vanilla React, it normally requires a lot of boilerplate code. This is because the form is built using a combination of state and props. To make it easier to manage forms, we use some sort of library.

## React hook form

React hook form is an opensource form library for react. Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.

## Formik

Formik is another famous opensource form library that helps with getting values in and out of form state, validation and error messages, and handling form submissions.

## Final form

High performance subscription-based form state management for React.
