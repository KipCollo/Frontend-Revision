# Props

The key prop is used to give a unique identity to each element in a list of components.
It helps React efficiently update and re-render the components by identifying which
items have changed, been added, or removed.

The children prop is a special prop that allows you to pass components, elements, or
text as children to other components. It enables the composition of components and
the creation of more flexible and reusable component APIs.
