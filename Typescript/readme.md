## Installing Typescript

To install the TypeScript Compiler tsc globally. You can use npx or similar tools if youâ€™d prefer to run tsc from a local node_modules package instead.

```js
npm install -g typescript
```

To check if it's installed use the command:

```ts
tsc --version
```

To transpile file from js to ts, use the command:

```ts
tsc <filename.ts>
```

However it's transpiled under the hood in frameworks.
